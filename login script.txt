MOTIVATIONS
One of the scripts that gave me serious challenge when i was a beginner.
Writing a code that gives a user login access and also displays the information from the database that particularly belongs to the said user was really challenging. I was happy when I finally got it and and with the knowledge and understanding i got i was able to implement a login system using PDO (PHP Data Objects).
